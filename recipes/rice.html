        <h3> A Delicious Wok of Fried Rice and a Classic Wooden Spoon</h3>
            <p>For me, fried rice has always been a comfort meal. It would be the only
            thing I could ever order at Asian restaurants and that may have annoyed a few
            people (cough cough mom). I don't know what it was, maybe the texture, maybe
            the act of ordering the same thing and always getting something different,
            I couldn't tell you.  All I know is that fried rice was always something 
            that I've loved.</p>
            <p>Although, this may have changed in the past couple of years.  My 
            boyfriend makes the most delicious fried rice.  I couldn't even begin 
            to describe how much I love the way he makes it.  From something that 
            was just a comfort meal that made me feel safe to a meal that makes
            me feel excited.  It's interesting, isn't it?  How a great person can 
            make anything great, just by touching it.  They may never know but it
            will always be true.  That might be the scaries part.</p>
