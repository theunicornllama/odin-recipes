            <h3>Delicious Green chili topped with cilantro</h3>
                <p>This is authentically crafted green chili. My mom used to make
                green chili just like this when I was little, seeing pictures of it
                reminds me of the great memories my siblings and I made over dinner.
                Over the yelling and the bickering, the fighting and the teasing,
                all done over a delcious bowl of chili.  Memories can often be forged
                in the dining room and I'm thankful that some of mine were.</p>
                <p>For me, though, memories of the past are always so muddled in
                experiences of the present.  I go to restaurants and order green chili
                only to be met with something that reminds me so little of my past 
                that none of it is pleasant.  It's hard to have memories and it's hard 
                to live with them, especially when they're entangled with food as 
                delcious as chili.</p>
